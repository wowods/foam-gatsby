# Color Code in Video Game

If you often play games, you will know right away when you been shown with two bars with red and blue color on it, that those bars are indicating your characters HP and MP. While sometimes the bars have color green and blue, you still will know that represent the HP and MP. But when there're three set of bar, which colored red, blue, and green, we also know that the green one usually represent a stamina instead of HP.  
This is how, we as gamers, perceive a color in a video game without need for explanation. Sure, you couldn't recognize it right away when you play your first game. But since most of the game have the same color code on it, we indirectly learn about the color code by playing the games.

The other and simple way to use color on the game is [[using-color-for-clickable]], which will draw player's attention and hopefully they'll try to click it :D.

But, this is not the only way to use a color in video game. For example, [[how-inside-use-color-as-hint]] is quite interesting topic to be further explored.
