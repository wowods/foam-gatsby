# The Birth of JRPG

JRPG or Japanese Role Playing Game are kind of RPG that derived from CRPG (Computer RPG). While CRPG try to mimic Tabletop RPG on the computer rather than using Dungeon Master and rolling a real dice, JRPG trying to do the same of CRPG but with limitation of console. That's why JRPG feels more linear compared to CRPG since the limitation of console cannot support the bigger world, the complex choice, or manually distributed stats. These characteristic more or less still persistent to the current state of JRPG, even the console is capable of doing more tasks.  

You could argue that from many aspects of Tabletop RPG as it inspiration, JRPG mostly heavily use the stats system and and the battle system (where the machine will automatically roll the dice for you).
