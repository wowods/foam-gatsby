# Inner Trauma in Limbo

When we have a trauma, usually our defense mechanism will try to prevent us to reveal the truth, since it could cause a problem with our mental condition.  
That's why, we often hear a story about dissociative amnesia or a person that struggle to overcome a problem that seems trivial. When this behavior is caused by trauma, usually we try to defense ourselves by avoiding that particular experience at all.

We could see that a lot of things in Limboâ€™s world are dangerous and will kill the protagonist in an instant. Basically, all the traps and dangerous environment will impending our journey to move forward, at least for the first time, until we as the player solve the puzzle behind it.  
This fact showing the theme of the game is about inner trauma, where all the things try to prevent the child to realize about the traumatic truth.  
(we assume that the little girl that we see and chase along the game, probably will make the child realize that he already dead)
