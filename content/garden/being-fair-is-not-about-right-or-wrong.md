# Being Fair, is not about Right or Wrong

Justice doesn’t always determine which one is right or wrong. It just try to act fair for all the parties that involved in the same incident. So, when somebody is punished or rewarded by the justice, it’s try to convey that it is something they deserve and that result is deemed fair by all the parties. Since they need to perceived from a lot of perspective to decide the result, it cannot be used as something to determine which one is right or wrong.

The "first trial” of justice could be read from Oresteia part III, [[The Eumenides|the-eumenides]], where Orestes avoid the punishment from [[the-furies]] by the trial held by Athena.
