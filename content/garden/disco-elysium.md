# Disco Elysium

Disco Elysium is a detective RPG developed and published by ZA/UM that being released on 2019.  

The game is about an amnesiac detective that try to investigate the death of a hanged man on Martinaise. A long his journey, he partnered with Kim Kitsuragi to help him regain his memories and solved the mystery.  

The gameplay is mostly a dice-roll for a dialogue based on your character stats. This will result on different kind of information that being exposed to the player upon interacting with the environment or anyone else. This part of gameplay that makes the game count as RPG, since we could make our character different type of detective based on our preferences and his stats. Eventhough it doesn't have unlimited choices on its playthrough, but the promise for the game are unprecendented choices which the game deliver really well.
