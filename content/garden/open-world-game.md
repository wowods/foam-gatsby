# Open-World game

Open-world game are games with the premise that you have the freedom to explore the in-game world without many restrictions, for example: Skyrim, Minecraft, Fallout, Horizon Zero Dawn, Zelda: Breath of the Wild.  

Even though it's called open-world, often the game doesn't really open all the area at once and let the player to be free from the start of the game for many reasons. And there's a lot of ways to restrict player's' movement in video game. For example:
- The player needs to acquire some item to access some area. eg: Zelda: BOTW limit the player inside "tutorial area" until they finished the tutorial by rewarding the player hang-glider that will unlock the rest of the world.
- Higher level enemies on some areas. eg: Octopath Traveler will told you the average level of the enemies on the area upon entering it. This way, the player is almost impossible to progress in that area until they level-up the party to that suggested level, hence limit the path that the player could travel to.

The other thing that important on open-world games are how to motivate player to explore the world.  Because it will be useless if you have a vast open world but the player doesn't want to explore on it. This is more important for player that extrinsically motivated *(see [[intrinsic-extrinsic-motivation]])* since they need some stimulus to start exploring the world.  
Some trick that will do this are:
- Separate the main quest to the other side of the map, so player is forced to travel across the map and hopefully will interact with the environment.
- Have quite a difference on level between each main quest, hopefully player will try to level-up by doing some side-quest or exploring the world to get level or better equipment/loot.
