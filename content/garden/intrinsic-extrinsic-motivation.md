# Instrinsic and Extrinsic motivation

Instrinsic motivation is a motivation that comes from yourself, the feeling when you want to do something because you value the effort or value the things by itself. You feel that you gain a reward by doing that activity.

Meanwhile, extrinsic motivation is a motivation that has an external reward to make it feel valueable, eg: you'll got reward (like money or fame) by doing the activity. This motivation doesn't inheritly bad, but it's harder to sustain in a long time compared to instrinsic motivation.

### Motivation in Playing a Video Game

In video game, we could see these two types of motivation occured on the player. For example, in-game achievement counts as extrinsic motivation and exloring a sandbox game or trying different things in  simulation game could be seend as instrinsic motivation.  

To put it simply, when the player playing a game for the sake of enjoying and "having experience" with the game, we could say it as an instrinsic motivation. While when the player feel being forced to play the game (either voluntarily or not), we could say that they playing it based on extrinsic motivation.
